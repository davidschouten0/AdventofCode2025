# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)!

This repository contains my daily solutions written in **Java**. I am using this year's challenge to sharpen my problem-solving skills and dive deeper into Java concepts.

## Structure

The project is organized by day. Each day has its own package (e.g., `001Day`, `002Day`) containing:

* **Source Code (`.java`):** The actual solution code (usually split into Part 1 and Part 2).
* **`explanation.txt`:** A walkthrough of my train of thought, logic, and how I approached the problem.
* **Input (`reqs.txt`):** The puzzle input used for that day.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/davidschouten0/AdventOfCode2025.git](https://github.com/davidschouten0/AdventOfCode2025.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in your IDE:** (IntelliJ IDEA is recommended).
3.  **Run:** Navigate to the specific day's package and run the `main` method.

## Note on Logic

I believe that understanding *how* to solve a problem is just as important as the code itself. If you are stuck or curious about my approach, checking the `explanation.txt` file in each day's folder is the best place to start.

*Happy Coding & Happy Holidays!* 🎅✨
