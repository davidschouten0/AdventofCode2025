Part 1:
    binary poitner approach:
        left pointer: first number
        right pointer: second number

        iterate till n-2

        Possibility A)
            if the second number > first number, switch numbers, make second number = 0

        Possibiliy B)
            Iterate over array once to get biggest num, note index
            Iterate over arry again to get biggest num after the noted index

        after Iteration, add the total of the line to the return

    Challenges:
        char is a number, need to offset 48 because 0 is 48 in ASCII

Part 2:
    Same kind of approach:
    Look for the biggest number in the subarray [0;n-12] (with n being the length of the array)
    Note the index k
    look for biggest number in subarray [k; n-11]

    continue this for all 12 numbers
    multiply by 10^the place of the number (starting from zero, going to 11)
