Part 1:

    Parse Instructions,
        when R - add amount
        when L - subtract amount

    Use modulo (actually floorMod, to account for negative mods)

    After one Instruction, check if Dial is at 0 (increase counter)

Part 2:

    Parse like before

    3 Cases:
        A) Doesnt point to 0 (-> curDial-curAmount >= 0 || curDial+curAmount <= 100)

        B) Underflow ((curDial - curAmount / 100) + 1)    Only happens with L

        C) Overflow (use Integer Division, like curDial+curAmount / 100)  Only happens with R

    Use same modulo logic to get the next curDial

    Challenge:  Handle starting from 0 correctly
                Forgetting, that -x/+y = -z lol
