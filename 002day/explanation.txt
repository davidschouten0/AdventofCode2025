Part 1:
    Iterate over every sequence, seperated by ','

    Possibility A)
        count over the sequence range, if an ID is of the schema aa with a being half of the ID
        --> increase counter

    Possibility B)
        Do the same thing but start a hashmap for every part sequence, so numbers from e.g. 10 to 100
        have a given amount of repetitions, makes for more efficiency, no need to compute the same thing twice

    I will go with Possibility A) for times sake
